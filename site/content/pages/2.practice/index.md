intro_text: |
  <p>Buck Projects is a Brooklyn-based architectural design firm founded by Brent Allen Buck in 2015. Current work includes renovations to townhouses and apartments in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
  </p>
  <p>Buck Projects believes architecture is the collaboration between many to create simple, timeless solutions. We are committed to process—we begin by listening and prefer to start by hand. Each project requires a unique, responsible design that we ensure is carried out effectively and efficiently. We pay attention to detail, scale, context, use, and materials.

  <h3>Originally from the Midwest, Brent grew up in a family of makers—masons, carpenters, tinkerers. From a young age he developed a deep respect for people who work with their hands. He received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Carnegie Mellon in 2003 and a Master of Architecture degree from Yale University in 2005. He was awarded the John Stewardson Fellowship from the University of Pennsylvania and the Drawing Prize from Yale University.
  </h3>
  <p>Prior to founding Buck Projects, Brent spent ten years as a project architect with the renowned firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects.
  </p>
  <p>Brent’s work has been published internationally, most recently in Architectural Record and in Architects’ Sketchbooks, published by Thames and Hudson. Brent has instructed the Carnegie Mellon Architecture summer studio in Kyoto, Japan and has been a critic at Yale University, Carnegie Mellon University, The Pratt Institute, and New York Institute for Technology. An avid collector of modern furniture, he has (to his knowledge) the world’s only complete collection of Jens Quistgaard-designed, teak pepper mills.
  </p>
  <p>Brent is a registered Architect in the state of New York and a member of the American Institute of Architects.

      <p>It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.
      </p>
      <p>So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!
