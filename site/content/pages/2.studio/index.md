Brent Buck Architects is a Brooklyn-based architectural design firm founded by Brent Allen Buck in 2015. Current work includes renovations to townhouses and apartments in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

Buck Projects believes architecture is the collaboration between many to create simple, timeless solutions. We are committed to processâ€”we begin by listening and prefer to start by hand. Each project requires a unique, responsible design that we ensure is carried out effectively and efficiently. We pay attention to detail, scale, context, use, and materials.
