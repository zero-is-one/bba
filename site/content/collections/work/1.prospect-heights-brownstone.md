      - 'Clients just want it done right. A year later they don’t care what it costs. They care that it works and hasn’t fallen apart.'
      - 'Follow-up, and again, and again.'
      - 'If a subcontractor is not working out. Let them go. Don’t push on... you’ll have to fix their work later.'

      <p>The home underwent a ‘gut’ renovation which includes new windows, façade, mechanicals, roof, kitchens, baths, and garden. Historically accurate ironwork was found in a scrap yard, front doors were designed and rebuilt, and interior trim details were inspired by the home’s original woodwork.

      <p>Approached with sensitivity, today can rise to be the equalof yesterday.
