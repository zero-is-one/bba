bio: |
  <p>Originally from the Midwest, Brent grew up in a family of makers—masons, carpenters, tinkerers. From a young age he developed a deep respect for people who work with their hands. He received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Carnegie Mellon in 2003 and a Master of Architecture degree from Yale University in 2005. He was awarded the John Stewardson Fellowship from the University of Pennsylvania and the Drawing Prize from Yale University.
  </p>
  <p>Prior to founding Buck Projects, Brent spent ten years as a project architect with the renowned firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects.
  </p>
  <p>Brent’s work has been published internationally, most recently in Architectural Record and in Architects’ Sketchbooks, published by Thames and Hudson. Brent has instructed the Carnegie Mellon Architecture summer studio in Kyoto, Japan and has been a critic at Yale University, Carnegie Mellon University, The Pratt Institute, and New York Institute for Technology. An avid collector of modern furniture, he has (to his knowledge) the world’s only complete collection of Jens Quistgaard-designed, teak pepper mills.
